FIRST START OFF WITH THE MUTHAFUTHA: git clone 'copy link from git hub'
Then do a: git status
Then do a: git add 'name of file(s). For multiple files just have a space between them'
Then do a: git commit -m 'PUT SOME MESSAGE HERE'
Then do a: git push

If something terrible goes wrong, just do a: rm -rf .git. If it doesn't work, try it in Desktop, or even the base directory

Do a couple of commits everyday, some many different things you can add. 

Pull: Getting an remote changes from a repository, must do before pushing if there are any updates to the repo. 
Push: Adding your local changes to the remote repo. 

So I guess a pull request is when you request others to look at your changes before they decide to pull your local changes. 
Just do git pull everytime you want to push something
