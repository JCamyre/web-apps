Use Django corey schafer
Make it a portfolio thing with links and pics to github links with all my cool projects
Add a stocks section: display pre market movers, be able to look at charts, have a watchlist that actually does stuff (be able to input price targets, alert if a stock has changed significantly in the past five minutes)
Just add python-trading method
SEARCH FOR PENNY STOCKS THAT WERE UP A LOT NOW DOWN, OR WHAT ABOUT WEBULL TOP LOSERS OF DAY



Do the ML program that can detect reps and half reps
Other webcam ideas: Trombone slide positions, Guitar notes/chords, tennis swing (gl with this one), 
Trombone guitar hero: tells you which position to play and you play it. Who cares about actual note, just position for now. Or could just do mic detects which note. 
I still want to do algorthmic trading
Watch kpop synchronisation video for skeletal mapping ML 



For my actual portfolio site: no need for users, focus on graphics/UI, get some cool BootStrap templates (for portfolio specifically?)
